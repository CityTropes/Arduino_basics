# Arduino_basics
basic wiring and programming of an Arduino/Elegoo UNO R3 board.



1. My_Blink: first test program - Arduino UNO R3 board's on/off LED ('L' LED), making it blink how/when you want.

2. My_RGB_Led: connecting an RGB-LED to the board (limit voltage to LED with resistors) and program the connected pins to show chosen colors at startup.  Next, keeps looping between colors.
