# Arduino_basics
basic wiring and programming of an Arduino/Elegoo UNO R3 board.



1. My_Blink: first test program - Arduino UNO R3 board's on/off LED ('L' LED), making it blink how/when you want.

2. My_RGB_Led: connecting an RGB-LED to the board (limit voltage to LED with resistors) and program the connected pins to show chosen colors at startup.  Next, keeps looping between colors.

3. My_Buttons (Digital inputs): programming 2 connected buttons (Input) and a ledPin (Output)

4. Active Buzzer: connecting and simple code

5. Passive buzzer: simple connection. 
      Code 1: passive_buzzer_Loop_of_notes
      Code 2: passive_buzzer_song_Beethoven_OdeToJoy
      Code 3: passive_buzzer_song_Take_on_me_Aha
